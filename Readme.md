# Real-Time Stock Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This system provides buy, hold, or sell recommendations for stocks based on an integration of sentiment analysis from financial news and machine learning time series prediction using LSTM networks. It aims to help traders make informed decisions by providing timely recommendations that consider historical trends and current market sentiments.

## Objectives

- Develop a model to predict buy, hold, or sell signals for specific stocks.
- Analyze movement averages and real-time prices, incorporating sentiment analysis from financial news.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for traders to receive real-time recommendations.

## Scope

- **Data Collection**: Utilize APIs and scraping to gather financial news articles, company financial reports, and historical stock data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis on news articles to gauge market sentiment.
- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Use LSTM networks to predict stock price movements based on integrated data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**:
   - News articles from NewsAPI, Alpha Vantage, or Finnhub.
   - Historical and real-time stock data from Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage.
   - Financial reports from SEC EDGAR or company websites.
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Text normalization, stop-word removal, and tokenization.
   - Financial data preprocessing and extraction of financial ratios.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Using libraries like TextBlob, VADER, or Hugging Face Transformers.
4. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Transform text data into numerical features using TF-IDF or word embeddings.
5. **Model Training**:
   - LSTM model for time series prediction of stock prices.
6. **Recommendation System**:
   - Logic to generate buy, hold, or sell recommendations based on model predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
